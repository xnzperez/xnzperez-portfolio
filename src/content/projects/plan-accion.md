## The Challenge

The Quality Department required a structured strategic plan to align academic objectives with institutional standards. The main goal was to optimize information flows and internal processes which were previously unstructured.

## My Role

As a **Lead Developer & Analyst**, I was responsible for:

- **Requirements Gathering:** Conducted deep analysis to identify bottlenecks in the current information flow.
- **Strategic Planning:** Designed the roadmap for the quality department.
- **Implementation:** Applied control methodologies to ensure compliance with management indicators.

## Results

The new structure allowed for better tracking of academic goals and significantly improved the efficiency of internal reporting mechanisms.
