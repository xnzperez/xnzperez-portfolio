## The Concept

A comprehensive solution aimed at helping Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) transition to the digital market. The platform manages inventory, users, and transactions efficiently.

## Technical Implementation

As the **Lead Developer**, I architected the full stack solution:

- **Backend:** Built a scalable RESTful API using **Node.js**.
- **Database:** Integrated **PostgreSQL** for relational data integrity and complex queries.
- **Frontend:** Developed a responsive and modern interface with **React**, focusing on user experience (UX).

## Impact

The prototype demonstrated how traditional businesses could automate their sales processes and manage inventory in real-time.
